# Welcome

Hi! Welcome to Stackie's 2023 Resolution. Feel free to see their [resolution](STACKIES.md), and you may get inspired too.

## What is this project all about?

**Stackie 2023 resolution** is a project where Stackies will share their resolution for this year, 2023. This project is part of an event called ***"Level up your skills with open source"*** in StackUp. This event is intended to advocate open source to fellow Stackies. The goal of this project was to apply what Stackies learned to the event. I will encourage them to contribute to this project and add green squares to their accounts. I'm hoping that this will be the first step in bringing to their attention how open source really works and why it's beneficial to them.

## Who are "Stackies"?

People who use the [StackUp](https://app.stackup.dev/) platform are called "Stackies." StackUp is a learn-to-earn platform, so if you are more curious about it, go check it out. So, in this project, only Stackies are allowed to add their name and resolution to the [STACKIES.md](STACKIES.md) file. However, if you see any bugs or suggest some features, *anyone* can contribute to this project.

## How to Contribute?

In order to contribute to this project, I highly recommend that you please read the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Feedback? Corrections? Comments?

Feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/AbbeyIT/Stackie-2023-resolution/issues).

## Who am I?

Hayo! I'm Abbey, and I'm currently a 2nd-year IT student. I am also currently a community moderator at StackUp. This project's goal is to get more people involved in open source, regardless of their occupation or whether they are still students. 

> Open source is for everyone.
