Branch away from the `main` branch and use the following schema for naming your branches:

``` 
git checkout -b <ANY-NAME>
```

5. Make changes
- Open `STACKIES.md` file. 
- Add your details to the table with your name, github handle, and your resolution.
- Make sure to add your name in **Alphabetical Order**.

**Example Format** 

```
| [Name](GitHub-Link)                | Resolution                 |
| [Abbey](https://github.com/AbbeyIT) | To focus on my health more |
```

6. Staged your commit.

Add your changes to the `STACKIES.md` file with the following command:

``` 
git add STACKIES.md 
```

7. [Commit](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/) your changes (write a short descriptive message of what you have done)

``` 
git commit -m "add <yourname> to Stackies"
```

8. [Push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) your changes to your forked version

Push your changes, use your branch name you created above

```
git push origin <BRANCH-NAME>
```

7. Go to the original project on GitHub & Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

You now will get a link in the terminal to create the pull request you can go to that link or go into your forked repo and create the pull request.

- On the GitHub website, navigate to your forked repo - on the top of the files section, you'll notice a new section containing a `Compare & Pull Request` button.

- Click on that button, this will load a new page, comparing the local branch in your forked repository against the main branch in the Stackie 2023 resolution repository. Fill up the necessary details there and click the green `Create Pull Request` button. 

- Your pull request will be reviewed and then eventually merged.

## How can I fix a merge conflict?

A GitHub conflict is when people make changes to the same area or line in a file. This must be fixed before it is merged to prevent collision in the main branch.
